    # If we have e.g. conda dependencies stored in "/path1/on/local/machine/environment.yaml", we can prepare the
    # work environment on each worker by:
    #   1. making sure each worker has access to this file i.e. see the `file_mounts` section
    #   2. adding a command here that creates a new conda environment on each node or if the environment already exists,
    #     it updates it:
    #      conda env create -q -n my_venv -f /path1/on/local/machine/environment.yaml || conda env update -q -n my_venv -f /path1/on/local/machine/environment.yaml

    # Ray developers:
    # you probably want to create a Docker image that
    # has your Ray repo pre-cloned. Then, you can replace the pip installs
    # below with a git checkout <your_sha> (and possibly a recompile).
    # To run the nightly version of ray (as opposed to the latest), either use a rayproject docker image
    # that has the "nightly" (e.g. "rayproject/ray-ml:nightly-gpu") or uncomment the following line:
    # - pip install -U "ray[default] @ https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ray-wheels/latest/ray-3.0.0.dev0-cp37-cp37m-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl"
