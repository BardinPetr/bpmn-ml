i want to make many tasks for my university students on class about software development business.
i am planning to give them some small business process, and them should be drawing BPMN diagram for their task. i want each student to have his own task to prevent them from cheating. so i want to have 100 different business processes. each task should be clear and concise, there should be clear what steps and actors are in, that should be in task. each task should be 2-4 sentences. student would have not much time, so for the process it should be possible to make adequate diagram as solution in 10-30 elements used (events, actions, so on). it would be better if at least half of topics would be about parts of information systems. please do it for me. i want to get 100 tasks as json string list.
it is important that all must be in RUSSIAN.
